            <p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">The city was first named Indreshwar which was named after the Indreshwar Temple in the city. Indreshwara temple- the oldest shrine at Indore, believed to have been named on its original patron- the Rashtrakuta king Indra III of the 10th Century. The Shiva temple was restored by Subedar Malhar Rao in 1741, in whose time Indore was an existing trading post and a camping site for guerrilla activities. Malhar Rao tried to rubberstamp the city as Malharnagari but the old name was not to call quits. It was this temple that gave Indore her name, and the Juni Indur came around.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">Indore is old settlement which started at the end of 15th century. Its original nucleus was a riverside village, which occupied the bank of river Sarasvati. This area is now known as Juni Indore. The little village grew as an important halting place for pilgrims traveling between great religious cities, Ujjain on the bank of the Holy River Kshipra; Omkerashwar on the banks of River Narmada. Later, in addition to the halting place it also became a camping place for forces of Moghul&#8217;s and Marathas who frequently moved to South and North for expanding their kingdoms. The Zamindars of village Kampel (about 10 km. S.E) visualized the opportunity of flourishing trade in this settlement and settled on the banks of the River Kanha. To withstand the foreign invasions, Zamindars built a castle, giving this village a character of a walled town, although the town hardly suffered the destruction of feudal wars. There was increase in trade and commerce with zamindars investing in the city and thus the city expanded as a trade centre.</p>

Later, their kingdom became a princely state under the protectorate of British India..</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">By 1720, the headquarters of the local pargana were transferred from Kampel to Indore, due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. On 18 May 1724, the Nizam accepted the rights of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I to collect chauth (taxes) from the area. In 1733, the Peshwa assumed the full control of Malwa.

By the time of his death, he ruled much of Malwa, and was acknowledged as one of the five virtually independent rulers of the Maratha Confederacy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">He was succeeded by Ahilyabai Holkar (r. 1767–1795), his daughter-in-law. She was born in the Chaundi village in Maharashtra. She moved the capital to Maheshwar, south of Indore on the Narmada River. Rani Ahilyabai was a prolific builder and patron of Hindu temples in Maheshwar and Indore.

Attempts by Yashwantrao Holkar to unite the kings failed, and he was approached to sign a peace treaty with the British. The Treaty of Rajghat, signed late December 1805, recognised him as a sovereign king and returned all his territories, including Jaipur, Udaipur, Kota, Bundi, and some Rajput lands from other kings.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">In 1811, the four-year-old Maharaja Malharrao Holkar II succeeded Yashwantrao Holkar.

As a result, Gaffur Khan Pindari secretly signed a treaty with the Britis to rule Indore as a princely state mainly owing to the efforts of their Dewan (Chief minister) Tatya Jog.</p>

The new Broad gauge line connecting Indore to the Kanhdwa &amp; western part of India also helped in the growth. After independence. The first ever-planning intervention in the post-independence period was in the form of Indore Development Plan (1974- 1991), which was published and adopted under 18 &amp; 19 of Town &amp; Country Planning Organization Act &#8211; 1973. The plan envisaged planning area was 21,410 ha, out of which 12,145 ha were provided under different uses for 12.5 lakhs population.
